# Monopoly bank account simulation

Just a simplified calculator. Together with a few friends, we figured out that we
could speed up most of the game by using a calculator to keep track of in-game transactions
instead of using the usual bills. This app is basically just that... a simulated
in-game bank account with a simple history feature. This app doesn't prevent you from
cheating, because it wasn't designed for children.
